# Spectrographic-Analysis-of-the-Magnetic-Reconnection

The present work was the result of our work at NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023.
The choosed challenge was Magnetic Reconnection (MR) because we wanted to understand
this phenomena. Our approach provided a simplified view of the data provided.

This project was fisrt developed as a jupyter notebook on Google Colab in order
to debug it. This files are present at "colab.zip".

Our slides presentation (in PDF format) is also present here.

A prototype site were created at wix in order to give a preview of an aplication.
