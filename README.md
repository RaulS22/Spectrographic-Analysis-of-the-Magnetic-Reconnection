# Spectrographic-Analysis-of-the-Magnetic-Reconnection

The present work was the result of our work at NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023.
The choosed challenge was Magnetic Reconnection (MR) because we wanted to understand
this phenomena. Our approach provided a simplified view of the data provided.

This project was fisrt developed as a jupyter notebook on Google Colab in order
to debug it. This files are present at "colab.zip".

We simplified the program developed on the notebook to several .py files, separated by year.

Our slides presentation (in PDF format) is also present here.

A prototype site were created at wix in order to give a preview of an aplication.

In order to execute our prototype, you must download the program_file folder and execute the file refered to the year you wish to see the overlapped
denoised graph of.

If you wish to see the rough and denoised graphs of the Bz mesured by the spacecrafts edit the parameter False of the function Bz_data_processer to True.

Summary of the graphs:
trace 1 -> ACE
trace 2 -> WIND
trace 3 -> DSCOVR
